  - The server branch only contains the folder `server` and its contents. **All changes to these files need to be made in the server branch or one of its subordinate branches.**
  - The raspberryPi branch only contains the folder `raspberryPi` and its contents. **All changes to these files need to be made in the raspberryPi branch or one of its subordinate branches.**
